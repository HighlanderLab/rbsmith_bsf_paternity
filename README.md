#Simulating Multiple Paternity in Black Soldier Flies

#This code creates a simulation that models experiments for detecting multiple paternity in Black Soldier Fly clutches. The scripts "MP_DetectionPower.R" and "PoolSequencing_MPDetection.R" are complete scripts, with explanations and instructions on how to use them in the scripts' comments. The former simulates a individual sequencing method, while the latter simulates a pool sequencing method. The rest are incomplete scripts that I committed to the repo while I was building the simulation.
