#Simulating Multiple Paternity in Black Soldier Flies

#This code creates a simulation that models experiments for detecting multiple paternity in Black Soldier Fly clutches. The scripts "MP_DetectionPower.R" and "PoolSequencing_MPDetection.R" are complete scripts, with explanations and instructions on how to use them in the scripts' comments. The former simulates a individual sequencing method, while the latter simulates a pool sequencing method. The rest are incomplete scripts that I committed to the repo while I was building the simulation.

#Files with the prefix "_OLD" are interim scripts I created as I was developing the simulation. Files with the prefix "_COMP" are composite scripts containing all the code I used to generate the data and figures in my MSc report - these scripts were divided into smaller chunks to run on the Eddie servers.
